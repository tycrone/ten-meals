## My Modifications
1. Restyled and added new items to API request. 
2. Resolved "undefined" errors that occurred when desired content was absent from API response by running results through function and replacing undefined values with value before mapping to Recipe component.
3. Styling edits, added 100vh fullscreen intro section, title, and centered search.
4. Added scroll effect and attached Effect Hook to when Recipe updates.
5. Added Modernizr and some cross browser polyfills for various CSS.
